# Dow monitor grouped-indicator semantic acceptance

Status: **PASS — production acceptance completed 2026-07-29.**

Applicable requirements: `REQ-DOW-MONITOR-INDICATOR-GROUPS-LAYOUT-001`, `REQ-DOW-MONITOR-LIVE-OBSERVATION-METRICS-001`, `REQ-DOW-MONITOR-STABLE-DECISION-METRICS-001`, and `REQ-DOW-MONITOR-INDICATOR-SIGNAL-BOUNDARY-001`.

## Executable evidence

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| specified focused Vitest suites | 5 files, 40 passed |
| specified specification/realtime contract pytest suites | 3 passed |
| `backend/tests/test_realtime_websocket.py` | 5 passed; one existing `asyncio_mode` configuration warning |
| `pnpm --dir frontend build` | exit 0; final broad-review build produced `index-DKdW77Ki.js`, `DowMonitor-BTJPiTJw.js`, `realtimeMarketData-CbJf3qZq.js` |
| `python scripts/check_spec_compliance.py` | only baseline findings: expired `EXC-COLLECTION-MONITOR-PREACCEPTANCE-DEPLOY-001` and legacy detail-toggle test path outside `tests/`; no active grouped-requirement finding |

The local Vite preview returned API HTTP 500 and remained loading, so it was excluded from semantic proof. The authenticated production browser supplied the browser acceptance.

- served entry: `assets/index-CTXmgw0J.js`, SHA-256 `1efc43b03be17e51bb2b6654e5e66b1596db78de2afd1a6eb674fdff1b4d9c39`;

The container is `running`, restart count `0`; `/health` returned `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.86","mode":"none"}`; deployment-window logs had no `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, or `Traceback`. `dow_monitor_symbols.json` remained `1d5955494b4a74d8ae32bd550e4f744e09c4cab80c85f190acd01f3717bef59e` before and after deployment.

An initial stale pre-deploy Chrome tab displayed its retained legacy JavaScript. Filesystem inspection proved `/app/static` is the backend serving root and is not mounted over; a cache-busting authenticated reload then verified the served candidate bundle. This is the only release retry; no data mounts were changed.

## Raw production data and recomputation

`/ws/realtime` returned `hello/v1` and a full `1347.HK` snapshot after subscribing to `quote`, `depth`, `candlestick` with `depthLevels: 5`. Raw inputs: quote `lastDone=136.8`, `open=137.2`, `high=141.6`, `low=126.2`; minute candle `open=136.8`, `close=136.8`, `volume=339000`; available depth bid `7000`, ask `109000` (the exchange supplied one level per side).

- candle change: `(136.8 - 136.8) / 136.8 × 100 = 0.0000%`;
- five-level request / available-book pressure: `(7000 - 109000) / (7000 + 109000) × 100 = -87.9310%`, rendered `-87.93%`;
- day-high distance: `(141.6 - 136.8) / 136.8 × 100 = 3.5088%`, rendered `3.51%`;
- day-low distance: `(136.8 - 126.2) / 136.8 × 100 = 7.7485%`, rendered `7.75%`.

The fresh authenticated row rendered stable 5m `+0.37%`, 15m `+0.44%`, ATR14 `+1.54%`, and confirmation `0/2`; it rendered missing live volume speed as `--`, not zero. Its formal `买入确认 08:00` was unchanged in two snapshots five seconds apart while the real-time book value was rendered separately.

## Browser semantic acceptance

At the requested 1800×1080 viewport override, `document.documentElement.scrollWidth === clientWidth` (1636 CSS pixels after Chrome chrome), while the table retains its own horizontal scroll container. A cache-busting production reload verified:

- exactly nine headers: stock, price/change, intraday, four grouped columns, signal, and action;
- each grouped header has two lines: trend/position, momentum/speed, volume/funds, breakout/risk;
- one polyline per displayed mini chart (five rows, five polylines);
- A/HK/US each render the nine headers and two-line groups; current lists are 1, 5, and 7 rows respectively, all within the fixed maximum 20 rows/page;
- `查看详情 01347.HK` opens once and the second activation closes it; no modal is used;
- HK formal signals and timestamps were identical over a five-second real-time observation window.

## Independent raw-input recomputation (round 1)

Read-only authenticated production overview for `01347.HK`: completed minute `2026-07-29T15:59:00+08:00`, final 5m closes `136.4` (`15:50`) and `136.9` (`15:55`), final 15m closes `136.3` (`15:30`) and `136.9` (`15:45`). Thus 5m is `(136.9-136.4)/136.4*100=0.3665689%` → `+0.37%`, and 15m is `(136.9-136.3)/136.3*100=0.4402054%` → `+0.44%`.

Final 15m OHLC bars (open/high/low/close) used for ATR14: `11:15 130.3/131.1/128.1/129.1; 11:30 129.1/129.1/127.3/127.5; 11:45 127.4/127.8/127.2/127.3; 13:00 127.4/133.3/126.3/133.0; 13:15 133.0/133.9/130.2/133.5; 13:30 133.3/134.6/131.8/133.2; 13:45 133.2/134.2/131.6/132.5; 14:00 132.5/133.7/131.5/132.9; 14:15 132.9/134.0/132.4/133.9; 14:30 133.8/134.7/133.2/134.4; 14:45 134.3/136.4/134.3/135.8; 15:00 135.9/136.2/135.7/135.9; 15:15 136.0/136.8/136.0/136.5; 15:30 136.5/137.4/136.3/136.3; 15:45 136.2/136.9/135.7/136.9`.

The 14 TR inputs are `1.8,0.6,7.0,3.7,2.8,2.6,2.2,1.6,1.5,2.1,0.5,0.9,1.1,1.2`, sum `29.6`; `(29.6/14)/136.9*100=1.5444015%` → rendered `+1.54%`. The same response has `current_price=136.9`, `vwap_price=132.88026484713833`, `vwap_distance_pct=3.025080629908339`; `(136.9-132.88026484713833)/132.88026484713833*100=3.0250806%`. Its decision has no dominant or confirmation timeframes, therefore live `0/2`; `monitorListPresentation.test.ts > derives stable grouped decision metrics from completed bars and decisions` independently asserts the constructed `2/2` case.

## Deterministic boundary/missing/pagination proof

Adversarial inputs cannot be injected into production. `monitorListPresentation.test.ts > does not let realtime depth change a formal BUY signal` uses a bid-heavy five-level book `300/250` (`+9.0909%`) and ask-heavy book `10/100` (`-81.8182%`) plus a `100→101` 1m candle (`+1.00%`); both retain the same persisted `CONFIRMED BUY`. `> projects volume speed only within the valid 1m observation window` covers valid, too-early, insufficient-12-bar, and `candlestickDelayed` inputs; `DowMonitorList.test.tsx > keeps missing grouped values explicit instead of rendering zeroes` renders `ATR14 --`; `> requires complete active-funds data` maps delayed capital to unconfirmed/null. `DowMonitorList.test.tsx > renders grouped columns with real-time and stable labels` asserts per-field `实时` labels.

The final broad-review regression extends the volume-speed case with a candle
at `09:35:00` and `now=09:36:10`: although the elapsed time is only 70
seconds, the observation is rejected because the two timestamps are not in
the same absolute minute. The original 20-second lower bound and 75-second
staleness bound remain in the implementation. The stable-metric case now
proves both a `FORMING` 15m snapshot and a truthy `provisional` 15m snapshot
are rejected independently by control distance and relative volume; each
uses the valid 30m value, while a populated 5m-only fixture still returns
missing.

Pagination is proven by `DowMonitor.test.tsx > shows three exclusive markets, twenty rows, and subscribes only the current page`, which uses 45 same-market enabled symbols and page-one `1..20`, and `> changes the WebSocket subscription with pagination`, which verifies page-two `21..40`; production 1/5/7 counts are not pagination proof.

Round 2 rerun is `pnpm --dir frontend exec vitest run src/components/dow-monitor/monitorListPresentation.test.ts src/components/dow-monitor/DowMonitorList.test.tsx` = 20 (15 presentation, 5 list). It adds `degrades each delayed realtime feed independently`: delayed candle clears 1m momentum while other feeds remain valid; delayed depth clears only depth pressure; delayed quote clears both day-high and day-low distances. The list test verifies the visible cyan live badge immediately precedes 1m and that the breakout cell has two such live badges for high and low.

Historical 21/2 subset is superseded, has no retained exact command, and is not acceptance evidence.

## Final broad-review production release

Release time: 2026-07-29 20:02 (Asia/Shanghai).

- source commit: `041a384`;
- image:
  `tickflow-stock-panel-app:dow-monitor-stable-fallback-041a384-20260729-200151`;
- image ID:

- rollback image:
  `tickflow-stock-panel-app:dow-monitor-indicator-groups-20260729-192023`;
- backup:
  `/home/alwin/backups/dow-monitor-stable-fallback-predeploy-20260729-200151`;
- exact Compose project: `dow-monitor-bfd819d438b4`;
- exact Compose files:
  `/home/alwin/apps/tickflow-builds/market-snapshot-realtime-20260723-1125/docker-compose.yml`
  and `docker-compose.override.yml`.

The new image is a unique layer over the running rollback image with only
`frontend/dist` copied to `/app/static`. Runtime verification returned the
new tag and image ID, `running`, restart count `0`, and
`{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.86","mode":"none"}`. The deployment-window
`ERROR|CRITICAL|Traceback` scan was empty. The symbol file remained
`1d5955494b4a74d8ae32bd550e4f744e09c4cab80c85f190acd01f3717bef59e`.

Local, container, and served hashes matched:

Fresh cache-busting authenticated Chrome pages loaded the new entry and
verified A/HK/US counts `1/5/7`, nine headers, one polyline per row, and
`documentElement.scrollWidth === clientWidth`. `01347.HK` detail opened below
the table with one selected row and no dialog, then closed and cleared the
selection on the second activation. Its grouped fields rendered stable
5m `+0.37%`, 15m `+0.44%`, volume ratio `0.70×`, ATR14 `+1.54%`,
confirmation `0/2`, live book `-87.93%`, and formal
`买入确认 08:00`. All five HK formal signal/timestamp cells were identical
across a two-second observation. A newly created authenticated tab loaded
`index-DKdW77Ki.js` and produced zero console errors.

The first switch command omitted the live Compose project name and Docker
refused the recreate because the canonical container name was already in use.
The live container remained healthy and unchanged. The single verified
`Created` temporary container was removed, then the exact live project
`-p dow-monitor-bfd819d438b4` was deployed successfully. No rollback
condition was reached.
